# n8n-nodes-userless-reddit

This n8n community node simplifies access to public Reddit data. Instead of relying on redirect URLs like the built-in Reddit OAuth2 node, this node uses a streamlined, application-only OAuth2 authentication flow (see [application-only OAuth](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#application-only-oauth)). This "userless" approach is ideal for retrieving public information and avoids the complexity of OAuth callbacks. Use this credential with an [HTTP Request node](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest) to interact with the Reddit API.

The package also provides a Reddit Posts Trigger node which triggers a workflow when new posts have been published in a subreddit. Compared to a normal RSS trigger, Reddit Posts Trigger retrieves data from API which has more information and is easier to process.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.
